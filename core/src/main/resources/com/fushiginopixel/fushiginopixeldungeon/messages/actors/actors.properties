actors.mobs.npcs.normalnpcs.npcabbey.chat1=Seeds are very important things that can get rid of some dangerous enemies! For example, when the cliffs are on both sides, throwing the seed of stormvine in front of the enemy can make it fall into chansm. \n When surrounded by enemies, you can throw away the seed of fadeleaf your feet and then put a thing under your feet so that you can escape. \nIf you are seriously hurt by falling, you can step on the seed of dreamfoil to stop bleeding. \n Find a dark corner with seed of sungrass to reply is also a good choice!
actors.mobs.npcs.normalnpcs.npcabbey.chat2=Potions are also very important, although some of them are dangerous. \nsuch as potion of venom, this must not drink, instead you can throw it on the enemy's face to poison the enemy. \nThe potion of levitation will produce a dizzying gas that works similar to seed of stormvine on the bridge. \n Potion of purity is an important alchemical material, but I don't know how to use it. I only know that it can remove volatile chemicals nearby.
actors.mobs.npcs.normalnpcs.npcabbey.chat3=The use of the scrolls is also very particular about! If you have a tough enemy around you and you can't win the combat, you can use the scroll of terror to scare off the enemy, you can use the scroll of teleportation to escape, or you can use the scroll of psionicblast to directly damage the enemy. When reading an unidentified scroll, it is best to ensure that there are some enemies nearby and there are weapons and equipment available on the body, so that you can make better use of it! \n Ok, it¡¯s almost like this!
actors.mobs.npcs.normalnpcs.npcabbey.chat1_0=Wow, you are back safely! You must have encountered a lot of difficulties, but you look like you've grown immensely from the experience.

actors.mobs.npcs.normalnpcs.npcabeys.chat1=Seen potions of strength? It can enhance strength, but it doesn't work for me. Your attack power will become stronger if your strength increases. If weakened, attack power will also be weaken, and you can drink potion of panacea.
actors.mobs.npcs.normalnpcs.npcabeys.chat2=The scroll of upgrade is the very expensive scroll in the store of the Sorcerer's College. It can replace the artificial power to make equipments more powerful, but it doesn't work for me either. The stone of enchantment can also make weapons and armors stronger through the hidden magic. It is useful but not stable.
actors.mobs.npcs.normalnpcs.npcabeys.chat3=I heard that a pot master from the East invented pot of fusion. This kind of pot can transfer the levels, enchantments and properties attached to other items to the item that is first placed. This thing is much more expensive than scroll of upgrade. I really want to take it away and then hand it to Alfred... \n Why still standing here instead of looking for your treasure?
actors.mobs.npcs.normalnpcs.npcabeys.chat1_0=Ha, you are coming back safely. Being able to come back means you are not weak. \n At first, Alfred was living with Abbey. Later, when they fought the demon, they damaged the demon hevaily, but they also enraged the demon. The demon wanted to perish together with them. Here there was a ripple in the timespace continuum; Alfred pushed Abbey away, and he was shredded by the power of darkness; Abbey blew Alfred away, and he absorbed the dark power of the demon and turned into me.
actors.mobs.npcs.normalnpcs.npcabeys.chat1_1=The two branches were intertwined in a spatiotemporal fluctuation event by coincidence. Alfred met me and then met Abbey. Even though I'm stronger than both of them combined, they were still able to use the power of the Galaxy Princess Rosalina to completely purify my soul. However, everything about me can't go back, I can't change back to Abbey... I have a soul that has been devastated by demons. It's ridiculous, isn't it?
actors.mobs.npcs.normalnpcs.npcabeys.chat1_2=...However, I can neither become Abbey nor can I replace Abbey. Maybe I should live as a new individual. As long as they can live happily, it is enough.
