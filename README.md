Fushigi no Pixel Dungeon
=======================

A Roguelike RPG, with randomly generated levels, items, enemies, and traps! 
Based on the source code of Pixel Dungeon, by Watabou, and Shattered Pixel Dungeon, by Evan.

Lots of contents of the mod are taken from Fushigi no Dungeon - Fuurai no Shiren(also called Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer). 

In this mod, I add some interesting mechanism, such as multiple enchant, village in the 0 floor, No going upstairs, stores robbing and so on. Also, more kinds of monsters are added to the dungeon.
